#GRAPHS:
A graph is a pictorial representation of a set objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.


#TYPES OF GRAPHS:
1.DIRECTED GRAPH:A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network.

2.UNDIRECTED GRAPH:An undirected graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional. An undirected graph is sometimes called an undirected network

3.WEIGHTED GRAPH:A weighted graph is a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight. A weighted graph is therefore a special type of labeled graph in which the labels are numbers (which are usually taken to be positive).

#REPRESENTATION OF GRAPH:
TYPES:
1.LIST OF EDGES
2.ADJUSCENCY MATRIX
3.ADJUSCENCY LIST

Graph Traversal
->In BFS visit a vertex and move on to all adjacent vertices
->In DFS after visiting a node select one adjacent vertex and explore it completely move on with other vertex

DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM
1.It comes under greedy method where solution for the given problem will be figured out stage by stage
2.It helps you to find out shortest path from one vertex to all other vertices
3.Drawback::If weight of any edge is a negative number this algorithm won't work for that
